[Garage Door Controller](https://github.com/andrewshilliday/garage-door-controller)
======================

I have deleted the upstream README so it doesn't go out of date. If you are interested in this software please go upstream.

My fork has some minor changes and such to get it working for me. I have also purposefully not pulled his authentication and notification.

The former I am not worried about as it is only accessible through my local network, the later I will be doing using pushbullet at some as yet undeteremined point in the future.
